To open, simply open index.html into your web browser. This is a
P5.js project.

This is an abstract clock that represents time using a clever
combination of circles, which are located inside
one another. The biggest white circle is the clock display (12 hours).

The hour hand is represented by the biggest red circle. The tangent of
the hour hand with the display's margin represents the hour.

The minute hand circle is inside the hour hand circle (second largest
white circle) and follows a similar principle.

The second hand is located inside the minute hand (smallest red circle).

Please let me know if you have any ideas or concerns about my code!
